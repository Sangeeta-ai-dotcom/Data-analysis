# Data Analysis using Python
analysis data by classification, linear regression then prediction.
I am uploading my internship project under Encryptix .
* This contains total of three tasks:
1. Iris Flower Classification and checking the accuracy
2. Movie Rating Prediction With Python
3. Sales Prediction using Python
* Task-3 shows that :
1. The sales that we have predicted is linearly correlated with the actual sales
2. The sales of the product increases linear with advertisement over TV, Rdio and Newspaper but the TV gives MOST increment in sales than the other two.
3. All the Analysis was done by model designing and analysing using Linear Regression.
